# **Final Project-DEPI**

*Project Overview*:

This project assessed supplier performance to support strategic decision-making. By analyzing key metrics like defect rates, delivery consistency, and reliability, the project identified top-performing vendors and highlighted areas for improvement. 

*Project Goals*:

1. Identify Top-Performing Suppliers: Highlight suppliers with high-quality standards and reliable delivery performance for long-term strategic partnerships.

2. Detect Underperforming Suppliers: Pinpoint suppliers with high defect rates and delivery delays that affect product quality and operational efficiency. 

3. Analyze Product and Plant Performance: Investigate variations in quality metrics across product categories and plant locations to target areas needing quality controls.

4. Establish Data-Driven Supplier Strategies: Provide actionable insights to support supplier selection, improve relationships, and reduce quality-related costs. 

5. Enhance Supply Chain Efficiency: Develop recommendations to lower defect rates, improve delivery performance, and optimize supply chain efficiency.,

*Project Highlight*

 Climate Change and its impact on Manufacturing and Logistics in Illinois!

Illinois has seen a significant rise in defect rates, particularly during the hottest months of the year, from June to October. These seasonal spikes suggest a correlation between climate change and operational challenges. Illinois is particularly susceptible to climate-related events such as flooding, thunderstorms, and other extreme weather conditions, which further strain its manufacturing infrastructure, with higher defect rates and increased downtime across all plants in the state. Specifically with "Springfield Plant Logistical Bottlenecks". Despite being smaller than Michigan in terms of area, Illinois consistently reports the highest number of defects, indicating that environmental factors specific to this region may be contributing to the issue.
